### What is this?

This is my university graduation/last year project. It's a chat system with end-to-end encryption. This repository contains the server-side application of the project and it's a Ruby on Rails application with PostgreSQL as the DBMS. The client-side of the system is an Android application written in Kotlin. You can see the source of the client app under this organization in the "Client" repository.

### Should you use this?

Probably not. At least not in a real production environment. The reason for this is:

1. Cryptography is hard and it takes someone who knows what they're doing to get it right;
2. Even if I knew what I was doing, it would be foolish to deploy untested and unproven encryption protocol;
3. I'm most certainly not qualified to do anything related to cryptography. After all I'm just a university student with little to no cryptography experience.

### Why did I pick this project and not something else?

During my university years, I was always curios about cryptography. So when my project/last year came, I figured this was my best chance to explore cryptography. I think I learned a few things, so I think it was worth it.

### How long did this take?

I began work on the project early May 2020, and I wrapped it up mid October 2020. So I worked on this leisurely and intermittently for about 5.5 months. I'd estimate that translates into 2 months of fulltime work.

### Why did I open source the project?

Because I saw no reasons to _not_ open source it.
